Now, six years after king William's heavy handed attempts to unify the country caused the secession of the Belgian provinces, will the Netherlands be able to come to terms with this loss and look elsewhere to its future -perhaps the colonies- or will it try to re-establish itself once more in Belgium?"
 DEI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "For centuries the fertile soil, exotic goods and hard work of its people have made the East Indies the place to be for enterprising Europeans -Dutchmen- hoping to make their fortunes.
