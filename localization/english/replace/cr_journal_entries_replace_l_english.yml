 #Native Removal
 je_indian_removal:1 "The Indian Removal Act"
 je_indian_removal_reason:2 "In response to the persistent encroachment of settlers on the lands of the #variable Five Civilized Tribes#! in the South, namely the [SCOPE.sCountry('cherokee_nation').GetNameNoFlag], [SCOPE.sCountry('chickasaw_nation').GetNameNoFlag], [SCOPE.sCountry('choctaw_nation').GetNameNoFlag], [SCOPE.sCountry('creek_nation').GetNameNoFlag], and [SCOPE.sCountry('seminole_nation').GetNameNoFlag], the Indian Removal Act has been implemented\n\nWhile in the North, indigenous populations have largely vanished, these tribes have remained resilient but increasingly vulnerable to the relentless march of progress. The Act provides a solution by compelling the tribes to relocate westward, beyond the Mississippi River.\n\nThis mandated evacuation aims to offer them a chance to preserve their way of life under self-rule in territories where their cultural practices and traditions can endure without the constant threat of settler encroachment, while ensuring the continued expansion of American settlement and prosperity."

 #The Age of Princes
 je_age_of_princes:0 "The Zemene Mesafint"
 je_age_of_princes_reason:0 "Ever since the days of Yekuno Amlak a descendent of Solomon and Sheba has sat on the throne of David. And so it is today. With the emperor reigning from his throne at Gondar. Reigning but not ruling. For since the assassination of Iyoas the throne has been occupied by weak emperors beholden to machinations of the Mesafint who install and depose them at will. The imperial provinces meanwhile have seen the rise of ambitious nobles who pay little heed to the puppet emperor at Gondar. And thus, with the prestige of the emperor at its nadir, the empire has entered the Zemene Mesafint: the Time of the Princes.\n\nThe most prominent of the Mesafint are the Wara Sheh -the Sons of the Sheik- who hold sway over Begemder and the imperial capital of Gondar. Hailing form northern Wello the Wara Sheh are -as their name implies- descendants of Muslim Oromo who have converted to Christianity. However the sincerity with which they hold to their new faith has been questioned by some, adding religious tension to an already frought situation. In the north the ambitious Wube has carved himself an empire out of the chaos which rivals the Wara Sheh in strength, and he seems poised to make a move for the throne. Yet his brutal methods has left him despised by his subjects and his vassals, who would not need but a spark to end Wube's ambitions. In the south Sahle Selassie, Lord of Shewa, has taken a different path. Mostly refraining from interfering in Imperial politics, he has instead put his energies to building his own realm, going as far as elevating himself to the rank of Negus -king. Yet his ambitions have been stiffled by famine and disease putting a heavy strain on the purse, while a conflict over doctrine is brewing threatening the unity of the Church.\n\nNow the empire stands at a crossroad; will the differing ambitions of the Mesafint cause a permanent breakup? Or will someone rise who can restore the prestige of the emperor and bring the princes to heel?"
 
 #je_acw_countdown_reason:1 "The one issue that the Founding Fathers of our great nation were never able to answer conclusively, was the question concerning the status of slavery within the union. This inflamed debate has only gained traction in the years since the revolution, and it is presently the singular most important issue on our country's political agenda. With polarisation rising and compromise an ever more distant prospect, there are those that argue secession is the only alternative to being dominated into emancipation by the central power in Washington. Sooner or later, the arguments will stop being made with words and start being made with bullets."
