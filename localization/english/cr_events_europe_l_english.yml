His cause, though humbled, remains a banner for those who resist the rising tide of liberal revolution.\n\nHis arrival in [SCOPE.sCountry('don_carlos_exile_country').GetCapital.GetCityHubName] places us in a delicate position. Though we are bound by conviction and belief, overt support risks entangling us once more in [SCOPE.sCountry('spain').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] turmoil. The European powers may view intervention as dangerous adventurism, and here at home, the scars of our own restoration remain fresh. Many still yearn for constitutionalism—a specter we have only just driven from these shores."

His cause—the restoration of absolutist rule in Spain—lies shattered. Defeated and disillusioned, he has renounced his claim and seeks to live out his remaining years in quiet obscurity, settling in [SCOPE.sState('carlos_arrival_state').GetCityHubName].\n\nFor a man who once fought to restore the divine right of kings, there is irony in seeking refuge in a republic founded on the rejection of monarchy.

Now, the would-be king retires to obscurity, not with a bang, but a quiet retreat—his ambitions drowned by distance and resignation.\n\nThough some among the [SCOPE.sPoliticalMovement('carlist_movement').GetNameNoIcon] see this as betrayal, and others mourn a lost opportunity, the exile marks a decisive turning point: a symbolic end to the Carlist wars, and a chance for national healing."
