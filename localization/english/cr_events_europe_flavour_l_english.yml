 cr_europe_events.1.t:0 "The Sound of Science"
 cr_europe_events.1.d2:0 "The #bold #variable [SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetFarmHubName]-[SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetCityHubName]#!#! railway has bore witness to an imaginative experiment to test a theory on the movement of the stars."
 cr_europe_events.1.d:0 "A professors at [SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetCityHubName] University has demonstrated the the validity of #variable Christian Doppler#!'s theory that the observed frequency of sound or light changes if either the source or the observer is moving."
 cr_europe_events.1.f:0 "A racing train, a blaring brass horn and a dozen perfect pitch ears have come together on the #bold #variable [SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetFarmHubName]-[SCOPE.sState('sound_of_science_state').GetCityHubName]#!#! railway for an imaginative experiment. At stake? Doppler's theory on the movement of stars. For if the theory that the frequency of a wave changes with the speed of an object is correct, then a noticable drop in pitch from the blaring horn should be observed as the train races past the spectators.\nSelected for their ability to hear even a 1/8th difference in pitch, the spectators carefully record their observations as the train races by. Now; after 3 days of tabulation the results are in... And... Uniformly a drop in pitch is recorded!"
 cr_europe_events.1.a:0 "Observation and experimentation is the foundation of knowledge."
 cr_europe_events.1.b:0 "One cannot know how unexpectedly a new truth can find a purpose."
 cr_europe_events.5.t:0 "The English Sitt"
 cr_europe_events.5.desc:0 "In the mountains of Lebanon lives a reclusive English Sitt -adventurer, archeologist and matron of refugees, outcasts and criminals- who has fallen deeply in debt. Now the local moneylenders are asking us to intercede and force her to settle them."
 cr_europe_events.5.desc_2:0 "In the mountains of Lebanon lives a reclusive English Sitt who has established herself as matron of refugees, outcasts and criminals who flocked to the protection her English banner provides.\n\nYet her many escapades are starting to catch up on her; from a punitive expedition against the Alawites to a failed archeological excavation at Ashkelon, she is left with debts far exceding her ability to pay.\n\nNow the local moneylenders and powerbrokers have requested we intercede and force her to settle her debts, one way or another."
 cr_europe_events.5.f:0 "As for my debts, it is not, as you think, 25 per cent, yearly that I have to pay, but 50 and 95; and in one instance I have suffered more loss still. Gold of 28 piastres they counted to me here at 45, which I spent at 28, and am to repay at Beyrout at the rate of 45... calculate that! -#italic Letter of Lady Hester to her personal physician#!"
 cr_europe_events.5.a:0 "Remind the moneylenders that #italic riba#! is #italic haram#!..."
 cr_europe_events.5.a_tt:0 "#italic Muslim (1598) narrated that Jaabir said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba (usury) and the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same.#!"
 cr_europe_events.5.b:0 "Perhaps we can ask the English to intercede for us"
 cr_europe_events.5.b_tt:0 "#italic All English subjects resident in the Levant are, by the capitulations, under the sole jurisdiction of their own Government, and all suits are carried before the tribunal of their Consul, and decided by him. Strictly speaking, we have no more right, under the law of England, to adjudicate in such matters, than to compel our subjects to appear before the English consul.#!"
 cr_europe_events.5.c:0 "Will no one rid us of this turbulent women?"
 cr_europe_events.5.c_tt:0 "#italic She could be extremely sarcastic, and her satire was often terrible. Many of her letters are 'illuminated' with her caustic criticisms. There was no end to her eccentricities. She had many whimsical tests of character both for man and beast, and, of course, was often deceived by both, to her cost.#!"
 cr_europe_events.5.d:0 "In the interest of friendship we ought to settle her debts"
 cr_europe_events.5.d_tt:0 "On most subjects she was not merely sane, but sensible, well-informed, and extremely shrewd. She possessed extraordinary powers of conversation, and was perfectly fascinating to all with whom she chose to make herself agreeable."
 cr_europe_events.6.t:0 "Queen of the Desert"
 cr_europe_events.6.desc:0 "The Levantine escapades of the #variable Lady Hester Stanhope#!, niece to the venerable #variable William Pitt the Younger#!, have become a source of some embarrassment to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis|U] Majesty's Government.\n\nPerennially short on money, Lady Hester's [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHestersLiege').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] moneylenders have appealed to the [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHestersLiege').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to settled her not insubstantial debts. Under the Capitulations [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHestersLiege').GetRuler.GetSheHe] has refered the matter to our consul in [SCOPE.sState('LadyHestersHome').GetCityHubName] to decide."
 cr_europe_events.6.desc_2:0 "Years ago the #bold #variable Lady Hester Stanhope#!#!, niece to the venerable #bold #variable William Pitt the Younger#!#!, left Britain to pursue her destiny in the Levant -or flee the gossips of polite society, whichever you will.\n\nPerennially short on money, her escapades have become the source of some embarrassment to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis|U] Majesty's Government; Lady Hester's [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHestersLiege').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] moneylenders have appealed to the [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHestersLiege').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to settled her not insubstantial debts. Under the Capitulations [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHestersLiege').GetRuler.GetSheHe] has refered the matter to our consul in [SCOPE.sState('LadyHestersHome').GetCityHubName] to decide."
 cr_europe_events.6.f:0 "On Malta she was told that she would be the saviour of the Jews; in Constantinople she peered the Sultan in the eyes; in Caïro she met Ali Pasha as an equal; Damascus she entered unveiled and on a horse; the Palmyrans hailed her as #italic Meleki#!; in Lebanon she befriended the mysterious Druze; for the murder of a French colonel the Alawites suffered dearly at her hands, yet when war came she granted sanctuary to all who asked for it. Today she rules as the half-mad prophetess of Djoun, a recluse who does not leave the walls of her castle and only converses in the darkness of the night."
 cr_europe_events.6.a:0 "For the love of her late uncle we will pay"
 cr_europe_events.6.a_tt:0 "#italic Her influence is vast with the Arab tribes and with all those who have suffered from Ibrahim’s army, or who sigh over the tottering condition of the Turkish empire. She, more than any person, can secure to England the friendship of nations whose goodwill must be vitally essential to our interests, when —and the time must soon come— we have to contend with Russia for the independence of the Porte.#! -Sir William Napier"
 cr_europe_events.6.b:0 "Her Ladyship is on her own, unfortunately"
 cr_europe_events.6.b_tt:0 "#italic These debts were incurred many of them for foolish reasons – so for instance she gave Rabbi Levy from Hebron 7000 piastres for having remained up with her a whole night and conversed about the Messiah etc.#! -Report of doctor Wolff to Lord Palmerston"
 cr_europe_events.7.t:0 "The English Sitt"
 cr_europe_events.7.desc:0 "The English consul at [SCOPE.sState('LadyHestersHome').GetCityHubName] has let it be known that [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHesterMotherland').GetRuler.GetHerHis|U] Majesty's Government has declined to settle #variable Lady Hester Stanhope#!'s debts for her.\n\nIndeed, he has repudiated all [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHesterMotherland').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] involvement, leaving the matter fully in our hands."
 cr_europe_events.7.f:0 "Now that, at last, she held the letter in her hand, Lady Hester believed all her troubles had come to an end. She never for a moment doubted what the answer would be. No more waiting and watching; no more of the low agony of hope deferred; no more debts and duns; the hour of her triumph and deliverance had struck, and she had come into her inheritance. She had worked herself up to such a pitch of excitement that the doctor actually feared she might break a blood-vessel. Alas! when she opened her letter, she found it was not the expected reply from Sir Francis, but a very different missive. It was her death-blow that she had unconsciously received."
 cr_europe_events.8.t:0 "The English Sitt"
 cr_europe_events.8.desc:0 "The English consul at [SCOPE.sState('LadyHestersHome').GetCityHubName] has let it be known that [SCOPE.sCountry('LadyHesterMotherland').GetRuler.GetHerHis|U] Majesty's Government will be settling the #variable Lady Hester Stanhope#!'s debts for her."
 cr_europe_events.8.f:0 "If X's story is true, and my debts, amounting to 10,000, or nearly, are to be paid, then I shall go on making sublime and philosophical discoveries, and employing myself in deep, abstract studies; although, as my strength is gone, I cannot work day and night as I have done. In that case, I shall want a mason, a carpenter, a ploughman, a gardener, groom, doctor, &c., so that I must have assistance. Income made out, 4,000 a year, and 1,000 more for persons like you, that I should want; and 5,000 ready money for provisions, buildings, animals, money in hand, &c., that I may start clear. -#italic Letter of Lady Hester to her personal physician#!"

 #The Little Veins of Lorraine
 cr_minette_ores_events.1.t:0 "The Little Veins of Lorraine"
 cr_minette_ores_events.1.desc:0 "In the hills of [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName], immense reserves of iron-rich #italic minette#! ore lie beneath the soil. For decades, their abundance has tantalized French industrialists and geologists alike. Yet the region’s promise remains locked away.\n\nThe phosphorus content of the ore makes it unusable in steelmaking with current methods. Without a means to refine it, the vast deposits of Lorraine serve more as a geological curiosity than an economic engine."
 cr_minette_ores_events.1.flavour:0 "For now, the furnaces of France must burn fuel from elsewhere. But should future metallurgical breakthroughs allow the purification of minette, it could transform the region into a pillar of French steel production."
 cr_minette_ores_events.1.a:0 "Its time will come."
 cr_minette_ores_events.1.a_tt:0 "When the #variable Bessemer Process#! is researched, a journal entry will become available to develop a method for purifying #italic minette#! ore and removing the #variable Minette Ores#! trait from [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetNameNoFormatting]."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.2.t:0 "Buried Riches, Stirring Promise"
 cr_minette_ores_events.2.desc:0 "For years, the vast beds of #italic minette#! ore beneath [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] have remained an untapped asset—abundant, yet tainted by their high phosphorus content.\n\nNow, with the recent development of the #BOLD Bessemer Process#!, industrial and scientific minds alike see a path forward. Though the new process alone cannot solve the phosphorus problem, it opens the door to metallurgical refinements that may finally make the ore viable for steel production."
 cr_minette_ores_events.2.flavour:0 "What was once dismissed as unworkable may soon become a strategic pillar of national industry. All it will take is innovation, investment, and the will to turn theory into fire."

 cr_minette_ores_events.2.desc_old:0 "Geologists and industrialists in [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] have long been aware of the vast beds of iron ore hidden beneath the region's hills—immense in scale, yet tainted by their high phosphorus content. Until now, this impurity has rendered the ore all but useless for the production of quality steel.\n\nBut recent advances in metallurgy—culminating in the development of the #BOLD Bessemer Process#!—have sparked fresh debate in scientific and industrial circles. If phosphorus can be removed or neutralized in the furnace, then these #italic minette ores#!, once dismissed as second-rate, might become a cornerstone of national industry."
 cr_minette_ores_events.2.flavour_old:0 "With ingenuity, investment, and coordination between science and industry, a new era of steel production could rise from the iron beneath Lorraine."
 cr_minette_ores_events.2.a:0 "This could change everything."
 cr_minette_ores_events.2.a_tt:0 "Unlocks the #variable The Little Veins of Lorraine#! journal entry.\nCompleting the journal entry will remove the #variable Minette Ores#! state trait from [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetNameNoFormatting], unlocking its iron mining potential."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.3.t:0 "The Iron Returns to France"
 cr_minette_ores_events.3.desc:0 "With the return of [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] to French hands, we reclaim more than territory—we reclaim opportunity long denied. Beneath the hills lie the famed beds of #italic minette#! ore: rich, vast, and once dismissed due to their phosphorus content.\n\nBut the times have changed. Our industry has advanced. What was once an unusable resource is now a national asset waiting to be awakened. Engineers and metallurgists propose a full-scale effort to harness these long-slumbering deposits."
 cr_minette_ores_events.3.flavour:0 "We could not mine it when we owned it. They could not mine it when they took it. Now we shall show them both what it means to forge the future."
 cr_minette_ores_events.3.a:0 "We’ll finish what we never could."
 cr_minette_ores_events.3.a_tt:0 "Unlocks the #variable The Little Veins of Lorraine#! journal entry.\nCompleting the journal entry will allow France to remove the #variable Minette Ores#! state trait from [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetNameNoFormatting], unlocking its full iron mining potential."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.4.t:0 "The Little Veins of Lorraine"
 cr_minette_ores_events.4.desc:0 "Our recent acquisition of [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] has brought with it one of the largest known reserves of iron ore in Europe. The region is rich in #italic minette#! —a sedimentary ore long known for its volume, and long dismissed for its impurity.\n\nThe problem lies in the phosphorus: while the ore is abundant, current techniques cannot refine it into steel-grade material. Engineers suggest the ore may hold future value, if advancements in metallurgy can one day neutralize its chemical flaws."
 cr_minette_ores_events.4.flavour:0 "A treasure too heavy to lift; an empire's promise waiting on science to catch up."
 cr_minette_ores_events.4.a:0 "We’ll keep a close eye on scientific progress."
 cr_minette_ores_events.4.a_tt:0 "Once the #variable Bessemer Process#! is researched, a journal entry will become available to develop a method for purifying #italic minette#! ore in [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetNameNoFormatting]."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.5.t:0 "Cracking the Minette"
 cr_minette_ores_events.5.desc:0 "Advancements in metallurgy have sparked renewed interest in the vast iron ore beds beneath [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName]. Though long considered unusable due to their high phosphorus content, new refining techniques may now make it possible to overcome this chemical barrier.\n\nIndustrialists and scientists alike propose a concentrated effort to develop a reliable method of purification—one that could finally unlock the region’s immense economic potential."
 cr_minette_ores_events.5.flavour:0 "Sometimes it is not the ore that changes, but the tools we use to shape it."
 cr_minette_ores_events.5.a:0 "Let the work begin."
 cr_minette_ores_events.5.a_tt:0 "Unlocks the #variable The Little Veins of Lorraine#! journal entry allowing you to pursue a method for purifying minette ore."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.6.t:0 "A Region of Sleeping Steel"
 cr_minette_ores_events.6.desc:0 "With [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] newly under our control, the region’s vast iron ore fields lie open before us. For decades, the high phosphorus content in this ore has stymied its use in steelmaking, but recent breakthroughs in industrial technique may finally allow us to overcome this limitation.\n\nEngineers now urge the government to act—before another generation of iron lies buried in vain."
 cr_minette_ores_events.6.flavour:0 "Some conquests yield land, others yield the future."
 cr_minette_ores_events.6.a:0 "Begin the effort."
 cr_minette_ores_events.6.a_tt:0 "Unlocks the #variable The Little Veins of Lorraine#! journal entry enabling you  to develop a method for purifying minette ore and removing the #variable Minette Ores#! state trait."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.7.t:0 "Unreachable Riches"
 cr_minette_ores_events.7.desc:0 "Our recent conquest of [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] has brought with it more than political control—it has brought us the vast minette ore beds that lie beneath its hills.\n\nOn paper, the find is extraordinary: iron ore in immense quantities, enough to supply steel mills for generations. But the ore is tainted. Rich in phosphorus, it cannot be processed using our current techniques, and will requiring technological advancement before it can be put to us."
 cr_minette_ores_events.7.flavour:0 "Local officials speak of its immense promise, yet our engineers shake their heads. For now, this vast treasure lies effectively useless—an empire’s prize locked behind a stubborn chemical barrier, awaiting a metallurgical breakthrough we have yet to achieve."
 cr_minette_ores_events.7.a:0 "A prize in waiting."
 cr_minette_ores_events.7.a_tt:0 "When the #variable Bessemer Process#! is researched, a journal entry will become available to develop a method for purifying #italic minette#! ore and removing the #variable Minette Ores#! trait from [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetNameNoFormatting]."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.10.desc:0 "Forged in Fire" 
 cr_minette_ores_events.10.desc:0 "Years of experimentation, investment, and innovation have borne fruit. Metallurgists working in [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetCityHubName] have succeeded in developing a process capable of removing phosphorus from minette ore—unlocking its full value for modern steelmaking."
 cr_minette_ores_events.10.flavour:0 "What was once dismissed as a geological curiosity, unfit for industry, can now be fed into furnaces across the region. Blast furnaces can roar, smokestacks rise, and steel flow where once only raw promise lay."
 cr_minette_ores_events.10.a:0 "Let the little veins of Lorraine feed the arteries of a growing industrial power."
 cr_minette_ores_events.10.a_tt:0 "Let the fires never die."
 
 cr_minette_ores_events.11.t:0 "A Fire Not Our Own"
 cr_minette_ores_events.11.desc:0 "News arrives from [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetCityHubName], where the authorities of [SCOPE.sCountry('occupier_of_lorraine').GetNameNoFlag] have reportedly developed a method to purify minette ore—removing its high phosphorus content and unlocking its full potential for steelmaking.\n\nFor decades, French scientists and engineers struggled with this very challenge, their efforts cut short by war and the loss of Lorraine. Now, the furnaces roar—but under another flag."
 cr_minette_ores_events.11.f:0 "The hills remember who first dreamed of what lay beneath them. But they do not choose who gets to dig."
 cr_minette_ores_events.11.a:0 "We will not forget."

 
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.t:0 "Ore Bed Extension"
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.desc_no_tech:0 "Recent geological surveys in the Longwy region have uncovered a startling extension of the minette ore belt. Previously believed to be confined to the Thionville basin, the formation now appears to stretch further west than anyone expected.\n\nThe newly identified deposits are vast—possibly rivaling those already known in the east. But enthusiasm is tempered by a familiar obstacle: the ore remains high in phosphorus, and thus still unsuitable for steel production with current techniques."
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.desc_tech_discovered:0 "New geological surveys near Longwy have upended long-held assumptions about the extent of the minette iron fields. Once thought to taper off near Thionville, the ore beds have now been traced significantly further west.\n\nThis time, the news comes with more than just academic interest. With modern smelting methods capable of handling phosphorus-rich ore, these newly mapped deposits represent a valuable and immediately viable industrial asset."
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.flavour_no_tech:0 "Until science catches up with geology, these western beds remain a promise unfulfilled."
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.flavour_tech_discovered:0 "Industrialists are already mobilizing. New mines, new rails, and new fortunes seem only a signature away."
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.a:0 "Mark the sites. The future may dig here."
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.b:0 "Begin preparations to exploit the new deposits."
 cr_minette_ores_events.20.b_tt:0 "This option is available because a method to make use of the #italic Minette Ores#! has been discovered."

 cr_minette_ores_events.26.desc_no_known_deposits:0 "When the borders of [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] were redrawn after the war, great care was taken by [SCOPE.sCharacter('border_treaty_drawer').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('border_treaty_drawer').GetLastName] to ensure that the vast minette ore beds near Thionville fell squarely under [SCOPE.sCountry('minette_ore_state_owner').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] control. The line was not accidental—it was geological.\n\nBut recent murmurs among geologists suggest that the iron-rich strata may not end so neatly at the new frontier. Preliminary surveys hint that the same ore formations could extend further west, beneath [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] soil. It is a possibility that demands closer investigation."
 cr_minette_ores_events.26.desc_known_deposits:0 "In the aftermath of the war, [SCOPE.sCharacter('border_treaty_drawer').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('border_treaty_drawer').GetName] made no secret of [SCOPE.sCharacter('border_treaty_drawer').GetHerHis] intent when redrawing the borders: the line was not drawn for culture or history, but for geology. By shifting the frontier west of Thionville, [SCOPE.sCharacter('border_treaty_drawer').GetHerHis] secured for the [SCOPE.sCountry('minette_ore_state_owner').GetNameNoFlag] the richest known deposits of minette ore.\n\nYet [SCOPE.sCharacter('border_treaty_drawer').GetHerHis] could not seize everything. Ore formations are known to exist on our side of the new border—less explored, but promising. Their depth, quality, and extent remain uncertain, but the potential is real.
