 je_cr_minette_ores: "The Little Veins of Lorraine"
 je_cr_minette_ores_reason: "Beneath the gentle hills of [SCOPE.sState('minette_ore_state').GetName] lie vast beds of #italic minette#! ore—an iron-rich sedimentary deposit whose sheer quantity promises industrial abundance. Yet this promise remains unfulfilled. The ores, though plentiful, are laced with high levels of phosphorus, rendering them unsuitable for steelmaking using current methods.\n\nLocal geologists and industrialists have long known of these deposits, but the lack of a viable smelting technique to purify the ore has relegated the ore to dormancy. Should our nation succeed in developing or acquiring a phosphorus removal process, such as an improved Bessemer converter (or similar innovation), the region could be transformed into a linchpin of our iron and steel industry.\n\nTo ignore these ores is to let an empire’s worth of steel remain buried. To unlock them is to forge the backbone of national power."

 je_cr_carlist_war_carlists:0 "God, Country and the Fueros"
 je_cr_carlist_war_carlists_reason:0 "The laws of succession are as old as the monarchy itself. The eldest son inherits; and if there be no son, then the brother takes his place. Thus has it been from time immemorial, ordained by God and sanctified by tradition. By these sacred precepts, His Majesty Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstName] stands as the only rightful [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of Spain.\n\nYet, in these tumultuous times, this ancient custom has been callously disregarded. Queen #variable Maria Christina#!, driven by ambition, has manipulated the late [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] #variable Ferdinand#!'s will to install her daughter [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstName] on the throne, defying the very laws that have upheld our nation. This betrayal has plunged Spain into chaos, pitting brother against brother and tearing at the fabric of our society.\n\nThis is no mere quarrel over inheritance. It is an assault on Spain itself.\n\nIn their unholy pursuit of power, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoIcon] have unleashed a war upon the very foundations of our kingdom. The Holy [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_catholic_church').GetNameNoIcon], which has guided Spain for centuries, now finds itself plundered and desecrated. The #italic desamortización#!—that vile theft of monastery lands—has stripped the faithful of their refuge, leaving the poor without alms, the widows without charity, and the villages without their shepherds. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting], claiming to bring freedom, have instead brought godlessness, robbing Spain of its soul in the name of false progress.\n\nBut their betrayal does not end with the Church. For over six hundred years, the Crown stood as guardian of the #variable Fueros#!, the sacred liberties of our [SCOPE.sCulture('cr_basque_culture').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCulture('cr_catalan_culture').GetName] subjects. These ancient rights, which have governed our lands since before Castile itself, are now branded as obstacles to modernity. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting] would see them abolished, reducing Spain’s proud provinces to mere subjects of Madrid’s tyranny. What is a [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle|l] who does not uphold the laws of his people? A tyrant in disguise.\n\nYet all is not lost. The true [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] still stands. Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] alone can restore what has been stolen—our Faith, our Laws, our Kingdom. Against the false promises of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting], we raise the standard of God, [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], and Fueros. Spain shall not fall to the enemies of tradition. We take up arms, not for ambition, but for the eternal order. We fight not merely for ourselves, but for our children, our altars, and our fathers' graves.\n\nLet the traitors tremble. We march for Spain!"

 je_cr_carlist_war_christinos:0 "Queen, Nation, and Progress" 
 je_cr_carlist_war_christinos_reason:0 "Spain stands at a crossroads. Two paths lie before us—one leading toward unity, stability, and progress, the other dragging us back into feudalism, clerical tyranny, and endless war. The choice is clear: [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstName] is the rightful sovereign, declared so by her father, [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] #variable Ferdinand#!, in accordance with the laws of the land. Yet the [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetAdjectiveNoFlag], clinging to an outdated notion of succession, would throw Spain into bloodshed rather than accept the will of their own [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle].\n\nLet us be clear: Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstName] has no claim but force. He was never the heir. The late [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle|l], in full command of his faculties, abolished the Salic Law and by #variable Pragmatic Sanction#! affirmed that his daughter would rule after him. The [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] call this treachery, but what greater treason is there than to reject the will of the [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle|l] himself? It is not Don Carlos who is defending the Crown, but [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] and her loyal subjects. The [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] cause is nothing but a rebellion draped in false piety, a movement of warlords and fanatics who would sooner tear Spain apart than see it move forward.\n\nAnd what is the future they offer? A return to the rule of monks and provincial lords, where fueros and feudal privileges take precedence over the nation itself. For too long, separate laws have divided Spain, placing loyalty to the province over loyalty to the Crown. The [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] claim to fight for tradition, but what they truly defend is a fractured, backward Spain where the [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle|l] is hostage to outdated customs. If Spain is to survive, it must be united, governed by a single just rule, where every Spaniard stands equal before the law.\n\nThey cry out in defense of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_catholic_church').GetNameNoIcon], yet what is their true aim? Not to protect faith, but to preserve the unchecked power of the clergy, who hoard vast lands while common Spaniards toil in poverty. The #variable desamortización#! is not an attack on faith, but a restoration of justice—the wealth of Spain should serve the people, not a privileged few. The Church will remain, but it must know its place.\n\nSo let the [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting]s weep for the past—we march toward the future. For [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting], for Spain, and for progress!"
