And so Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstName] is our rightful [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. Or at least so it would be were it not for the kniving Queen #variable Maria Christina#! and her machinations to install her own daugher [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstName] to the throne by having the late king cast aside these ancient laws.\n\nAnd this has not been the transgression against the ancient laws and customs of our land.\n\nSiding with the most radical of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoIcon] to shore up her rule, the Holy [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_catholic_church').GetNameNoIcon] has been subject to vicious attack. The #italic desamortización#! of the monastaries being only the most recent of her crimes, tearing apart the fabric of our society.\n\nThe very rights these [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting] claim to be advancing are instead being trampled upon. For over 600 years our [SCOPE.sCulture('cr_basque_culture').GetName] subjects had their rights and privileges -#variable Fueros#!-  protected by the Crown. But now this very same Crown seeks to abolish these ancient rights in the name of 'progress'.\n\nIt is only Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstName] who can turn this Liberal tide and stand as protector of God, Country and Fueros!"

 je_cr_carlist_war_christinos:0 "The Carlist Question" 
 je_cr_carlist_war_christinos_reason:0 "Having no sons to inherent the throne the late King Ferdinand promulgated a #variable Pragmatic Sanction#! to pave the way for his daughter [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstName] to inherent. A move not hailed by all, especially not the king's brother Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstName] who was set to inherent. When the King met his untimely death in 1833, the question of inheritance was raised once more. By law [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] was crowned [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], but Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] has raised his banner in rebellion to press his own claim to the throne.\n\nThe [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] cause, however, runs deeper than just Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] his ambition. For decades [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetNameNoFormatting] languished in political turmoil under the indecision of Ferdinand. Swinging between the forces of progress and reaction, Ferdinand managed to satisfy neither. The last -omnious- decade of his rule being especially damaging, for he angered both the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoIcon] with his absolutist tendencies and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_catholic_church').GetNameNoIcon] by not reinstituting the Inquisistion.\n\nAnd so the conflict simmered until the King's death. With the ascension of [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting] to pendulem has swung in favour of the forces of Progress. Still an infant -a puppet of the forces surrounding [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetHerHis]- [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetHerHis] mother has aligned herself with the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting] to secure [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_christinos').GetRuler.GetHerHis] rule. In reaction the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_catholic_church').GetNameNoFormatting] and the conservative [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_spanish_landowners').GetNameNoFormatting] found their own champion in Don [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_carlists').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting].\n\nWith the pieces in place it was only a matter of time until war would break out. The sprak to set it all of? An attempted to modernise the countries administration which impinged on the #variable Fueros#!; the traditional rights and privileges of the [SCOPE.sCulture('cr_basque_culture').GetName] counties."

 je_cr_ferdinando_po_reason:0 "Currently -and illegally- occupied by [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_fernado_po_owner').GetNameNoFormatting], [SCOPE.sState('cr_fernando_po_state').GetNameNoFormatting] was originally ceded to us by the [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_fernado_po_prev_owner').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] in 1778, and was intended as a base for us to centralise our slave trading activities on. However the depravities of the Napoleonic Wars and -of course- the subsequent loss of our American Empire, meant those plans came to naught. Should we desire to expand our interest in [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('cr_biafra').GetName], we could try and leverage this treaty to regain possession over the island and use it as a springboard to grow our presence in the region.\n\nThe [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_fernado_po_owner').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] might not be keen to part with the island though as the island has become the home of their West Africa Squadron, which -in quite a twist of fate- is tasked with the suppression of the slave trade in the region."

Yet our hopes of turning the island into a bastion of the [GetLawType('law_slave_trade').GetName] for our American Empire were dashed by our involvement in the American Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic War and -of course- the subsequent loss of our American Empire.\n\nWithout purpose [SCOPE.sState('cr_fernando_po_state').GetNameNoFormatting] languished until the [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_fernado_po_owner').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] took possession of it for use of their West African Squadron. And so -in quite the twist of fate- the island now serves as bastion to suppress the slave trade instead.\n\nThe noblest of pursuits of course, but -with our own interests in [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('cr_fernando_po_region').GetName] reinvigorated- we should perhaps enforce our claim to the island."
