 JLN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once the Mek Nimr ruled a vast area of the Sudan as the king of Shedi, but that all changed on that faithful day when he met Ismail, son of Muhammed Ali: Ismail inflicted a grievous insult and Mek Nimr responded with vengeance: burning down the house Ismail had so foolishly decided to camp in that night. On his turn, Muhammad Ali's reaction to the killing of his son was devastating; ordering the Defterdar to inflict inhuman cruelties on Mek Nimr's capital of Shendi before burning it to the ground.\n\nBereft of his center of power, Mek Nimr and his remnants were forced into the borderlands with Ethiopia, where he now eeks out a living raiding Egyptian outposts. Will Mek Nimr be resigned to this fate, or will he be able to orchestrate a triumphant return to Shedi and force the Egyptians from the Sudan?"

Assigned with the sacred task of bringing Islam to the unbelievers of the Fombina and await the arrival for Mahdi, who was said to be coming from the east.\n\nThat was almost 30 years ago and the Mahdi is yet to be seen. What instead shall the future bring?"
