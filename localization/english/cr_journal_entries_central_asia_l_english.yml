 je_cr_kyrgyz_tribes_reason:0 "The Kyrgyzs form the pillar of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName], fulfilling administrative roles both high and low. But not all Kyrzygs have been created equally, for it is only the Southern Kyrzygs of the Alay and Fergana which have embraced our rule. The Northern Kyrgyzs of the Tien Shan, on the other hands, have proven less accomodating to our rule, sticking to their wild ways. And that, for us, is a problem, for through the Tien Shan, along the Kyssyl Kul, lay the profitable trade routes to Urumqi and China beyond.\n\nProtecting the caravans is proving to be a handful; a single clan subdued, and the next one is poised to rise. Only our skillful manipulating of their internal rivalries has granted us a semblance of control over them. But such control requires ever vilgilance, for us to ever be on the look out for one who could unify the clans against us."
