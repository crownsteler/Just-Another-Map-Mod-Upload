 je_cr_indian_removal:1 "The Indian Removal Act"
 je_indian_removal_reason:2 "While in the North the Indians have long since dissappeared, in the South the Five Civilised Tribes -the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole- were until recently still firmly established. It would be hard to argue that they were prospering though: they were subject of continuous encroachment by settlers seeking new, fertile, lands to farm. In this march of progress, it is unlikely that their way of life -or indeed they themselves- would survive for long.\n\n The Indian Removal Act has been enacted to allow -force- the tribes to evacuate West, across the Mississippi, where they can live and preserve their way of life under self-rule."

 je_cr_robinson_treaties:1 "The Lake Superior Copper Rush"
 je_cr_robinson_treaties_reason:0 "Traditional the economy of the shores of Lake Superiour has revolved around fur trading with Ojibwe trappers providing beaver pelts. First to French Voyageurs, and now to the Hudson Bay Company. And while copper deposits have been known for centuries, exploration has so far not amounted to much. This is set to change, however, as large deposits of copper have been found across the lake in Michigan. Hopes are high that similar deposits can found on the northern shore and fortunes can be made.\n\nHigh as the hopes may be, there is the small matter of land ownership to be dealt with: For the local Ojibwe still hold the aboriginal title to the land, and -under the stipulations of the Royal Proclamation of 1763- no development can take place without their consent.\n\nThe $ig_industrialists$ are therefore pressuring the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to open up the region to economic development by entering into a treaty with the Ojibwe."

 #Canadian Rebellions
 je_cr_chateau_clique:0 "The Lower Canadian Tax Revolt"
 je_cr_chateau_clique_reason:0 "For years a conflict has been simmering in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] between the minority [SCOPE.sCulture('anglo_canadian_culture').GetName] merchants -who form an oligrachy around the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] and defacto rule the colony- and the [SCOPE.sCulture('franco_canadian_culture').GetName] majority who are effectively disenfranchised, with both representing a different future for the colony.\n\nCollectively refered to as the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_industrialists').GetNameNoIcon], the [SCOPE.sCulture('anglo_canadian_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] merchants seek to unite with [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_upper_canada').GetName] and bring it under [SCOPE.sCulture('english_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] hegemony by marginalising [SCOPE.sCulture('franco_canadian_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] culture. They have set their sights on abolishing the Civil Law system in favour of the [SCOPE.sCulture('english_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] Common Law system, abolishing the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_landowners').GetNameNoIcon]al System and promoting the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_anglican_church').GetNameNoIcon] as national church.\n\nOpposing them are the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetNameNoIcon] who seek to preserve their [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_original_coloniser_quebec').GetAdjective] heritage by leveraging their demographic advantage, and eventually work toward, if not full independence, then a status as a separate Dominion within the British Empire.\n\nWith the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting] sweeping the 1834 elections tension are coming to a head. Penned by [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetLeader.GetFullName] the #variable 92 Resolutions#!, an audacious petition detailing [SCOPE.sCulture('franco_canadian_culture').GetNameNoFormatting] grievances, has been sent to [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_lower_canada_overlord').GetCapital.GetCityHubName]. First and foremost resolution is that of #variable Responsible Government#! -a demand for full internal autonomy and popular elections, effectively handing over power to the [SCOPE.sCulture('franco_canadian_culture').GetNameNoFormatting]. Accompanying the petitions come veiled threats of the colony going the way of the American colonies if the demands are not met. A legislative tax revolt instituted by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting] is but the first step of strengthening their demands."
 
 je_cr_chateau_clique_UNUSED:1 "The Château Clique"
 je_cr_chateau_clique_reason_UNUSED:0 "While under the Constitutional Act of 1791 there is nominal popular representation through the elected House of Assembly, real power within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag] lies not with them, but with the unelected Legislative and Executive Councils. Appointed by the governor these councils can vote down legislation proposed by the House of Assembly and -perhaps more importantly- have close access to the governor and can advise [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] when to apply [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] veto.\n\nAn already a deeply unpopular arrangement on its own, the fact that this [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_landowners').GetNameNoIcon] is almost wholely made up of [SCOPE.sCulture('english_culture').GetName] merchants is only fuel to the fire. This Clique doesn't just represent the interests of merchants and industrialists -and the economic changes that comes with that-, but also actively work for the assimilation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] into an [SCOPE.sCulture('anglo_canadian_culture').GetName] province, cutting deep into the [SCOPE.sCulture('franco_canadian_culture').GetName] identity by trying to replace the Civil Law system with a Common Law system, replacing the Catholic Church with the Anglican Church and abolishing the Seigneurial system.\n\nTension over this issue are reaching a boiling point. In 1834 the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetNameNoIcon] swept power in the elections under leadership of [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetLeader.GetFullName]."
 je_cr_92_resolutions_ENG:1 "The 92 Resolutions"
 je_cr_92_resolutions_ENG_reason:0 "Not all is well in our colony of [SCOPE.sCountry('cr_lower_canada').GetName]. Ever since taking control of the territory of the French in 1763 we have had to balance our designs against those of the native French inhabitants, cumulating in the 1791 Constitutional Act, which guarantees the political rights and privileges of the peoples of the two Canadas, as well as participatory government in the form of elected assemblies. Yet it are these assemblies which have now become a hotbed of seditious and revolutionary activity.\n\nUnder the leadership [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetLeader.GetFullName] -and with broad popular support- the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetNameNoIcon] have taken control of the elected House of Assembly, and are agitating for political reform. Their manifesto is laid out of the #variable 92 Resolutions#! they sent to Parliament in 1834, and to which we are yet to offer a response.\n\nMuch of their ire is aimed at the so called Château Clique, the [SCOPE.sCulture('anglo_canadian_culture').GetName] -loyalist- merchants who dominate the -unelected- Legislative and Executive Councils, where most of the political power lies. They demand that power be vested in the -[SCOPE.sCulture('franco_canadian_culture').GetName]- dominated House of Assembly. But below the surface also simmers a fear of being dominated by the [SCOPE.sCulture('anglo_canadian_culture').GetNameNoFormatting], who are already almost a majority in Quebec and Montreal, and -by immigration and economic power- could swamp the [SCOPE.sCulture('franco_canadian_culture').GetNameNoFormatting].\n\nUntill their demands are met, a move to 'responsible government' (self rule), better representation, official protection and use of the French language and a fairer taxation, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cr_canadian_liberals').GetNameNoFormatting] are using the powers vested in the House of Assembly to block the levying of further taxes, and have offered veiled threats that the colony might go the way of the American colonies."

 #North American Fur Trade

 je_cr_russian_america_reason:0 "It was otter and the beaver which brought us to the shores of Alaska. For their valuable pelts had formed the impetus for the Eastward Expasion. First across Siberia, then across the Far East, and finally across the Bering Strait into the Americas, always in the pursuit of new hunting grounds, always pursuing new riches. The Russian-American Company now stands as the furthest outposts of our empire, controlling the Maritime fur trade from their headquarters at Novo-Arkhangelsk.\n\nYet the future of the company is uncertain: The company relies extensively on lucrative sea otter pelts to supply the Chinese fur market, but the population of sea otters is already showing signs of decline, though rich pelting grounds in the American interiour might create a new economic lifeline. More troubling is the remoteness of the territory: Hard to supply and defend, should the Mexicans, Americans or -worse- the British decide to turn their eyes on the territory, they could overwhelming it easily." #Somehow work into a reference to the Promyshlenniki

For a few glorious decades excessive fortunes could be made to all who ventured this far. But alas all good things must come to end. Where once thousands of pelts could be harvested every season, a few hundred is already considerd a good harvest, with most not even coming from the lucrative sea otter, but from fur seals instead.\n\nWith stocks so severely depleted, it will not be long before the Californian fur trade will end completely.\n\nFort Ross, our outpost in the region, therefore stands at a cross roads: with a major investment it could, perhaps, be turned into an agricultural colony to supply our posts in Alaska, or it will slowly wither and die as the last otters and fur seals are harvested in the region."
